<h2><a href="KnownVulnerabilities.html" target="_blank">Project 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment</a></h2>
        <h4>Known Vulnerabilities and Exploits</h4>

<p> This paper on known vulnerabilities and exploits provides a detailed overview of common security weaknesses in major systems such as Windows, VMware ESXi, Apache, and PHP. Its primary objective is to highlight critical vulnerabilities like EternalBlue, BlueKeep, PrintNightmare, and various buffer overflow and remote code execution threats, explaining how attackers exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. The paper also emphasizes mitigation strategies and the importance of proactive security measures to reduce risk.
This work is valuable for cybersecurity because it demonstrates an understanding of real-world threats, their technical mechanisms, and practical defenses. It shows the ability to recognize system weaknesses, assess risk, and implement strategies to protect sensitive data and network infrastructure.
The relevance to cybersecurity is reinforced through its discussion of mitigation strategies, including regular system updates, strict access controls, input validation, network segmentation, and firewalls. The paper also covers monitoring tools like IDS, SIEM, and log analysis to detect and respond to incidents quickly. By combining knowledge of vulnerabilities with defensive measures, this work reflects critical skills in threat assessment, risk management, and proactive system protection—core competencies required for effective cybersecurity practice.

<h2><a href="DatabaseAdministration.html" target="_blank">Project 2: Database Administration</a></h2>
        <h4>Performance Tuning & Optimization for Database Administrators</h4>

<p> This paper on Performance Tuning and Optimization explains how organizations can maintain efficient and reliable database systems through both proactive and reactive strategies. The main goal is to ensure that systems meet performance requirements, minimize downtime, and reduce operational risks. It covers a wide range of maintenance tasks, including database indexing, query performance analysis, updating statistics, archiving old data, testing backups, monitoring resources, configuration tuning, applying security patches, and automating jobs. Each task includes practical problem-solving approaches, showing how to handle issues like fragmented indexes, inefficient queries, or failed backups.
The paper is valuable for cybersecurity because it demonstrates skills in system reliability, risk mitigation, and operational security. Maintaining database performance is critical not just for efficiency, but also for protecting sensitive data and ensuring continuity of service, which are key aspects of cybersecurity.
The relevance to cybersecurity is highlighted through tasks such as security patching, backup testing, and monitoring, which show a clear understanding of safeguarding systems against vulnerabilities and failures. By outlining both the technical steps and the reasoning behind them, this work reflects the analytical, methodical, and preventative skills essential for cybersecurity roles, making it a strong example of practical IT competence.

<h2><a href="IncidentResponse.html" target="_blank">Project 3: Incident Response</a></h2>
        <h4>Detecting and cleaning up malicious processes</h4>

<p>This paper reflects the work I completed for Objective 5, where the goal was to locate and stop malicious processes running on a compromised host. The task required me to use multiple tools, including VNC, Remote Desktop Protocol, and Process Explorer, to investigate suspicious activity and confirm the presence of WannaCry-related files and processes. I identified malware such as av.exe, mssecsvc2.0, and tasksche.exe, which were designed to look like legitimate system processes. By analyzing system internals, tracing process trees, and examining hidden file paths, I was able to terminate the malicious services and contain the infection by stopping the spreading service.
This piece of work is important because it demonstrates practical, hands-on incident response skills rather than just theoretical knowledge. I not only found and removed malicious executables, but also used log data, system administration commands, and malware analysis techniques to verify and mitigate the infection. These steps mirror real-world practices that security teams would perform during a ransomware outbreak.
The relevance of this objective lies in its emphasis on process forensics, malware containment, and system hardening. These are core skills in cybersecurity work, showing the ability to analyze, identify, and respond effectively to live threats in an enterprise environment.

<h2><a href="EthicsandIT.html" target="_blank">Project 4: Ethics & Information Technology</a></h2>
        <h4>IT Equipment Usage and Abuse Prevention Guidelines and Policies</h4>

<p>This paper on Guidelines provides a comprehensive overview of how organizations can maintain secure, ethical, and productive workplaces. Its main objective is to outline policies that protect company assets, prevent cyber-attacks, and ensure employee compliance with legal and ethical standards. Key areas include preventing Denial of Service attacks, proper software and email usage, implementing strong cybersecurity measures like MFA, regular backups, and monitoring for suspicious activity. The guidelines also emphasize ethical decision-making in software development, data privacy, intellectual property compliance, and workplace monitoring.
This work is valuable for cybersecurity because it demonstrates an understanding of policy-based risk management and proactive threat prevention. These are indispensable skills for protecting organizational systems. It also highlights the practical implementation of security measures, from phishing awareness training to software licensing compliance, which directly relate to cybersecurity responsibilities.
The relevance to cybersecurity work is further reinforced through the detailed discussion of monitoring, reporting, and remediation procedures, as well as compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA. By addressing both human behavior and technical controls, this paper reflects critical skills in risk assessment, policy enforcement, and ethical decision-making, all of which are necessary for effective cybersecurity management and maintaining a secure organizational environment.

<h2><a href="ITGov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project 5: IT Governance Framework</a></h2>
        <h4>IT Operation Alignment with Business Goals</h4>
		
<p>This paper on Trane Technologies’ IT Governance Framework explains how the company aligns its IT operations with overall business goals. The main purpose is to show how IT can support organizational objectives while maintaining compliance, reducing risks, and ensuring smooth operations. It walks through important steps like communicating IT strategies, defining clear decision-making roles, implementing risk management, creating disaster recovery plans, and tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to maintain reliability and trust within the organization.
This piece is a strong addition to cybersecurity because it demonstrates an understanding of IT governance, which is essential for protecting data and ensuring organizational compliance. It shows knowledge of assessing risks, implementing policies, and using structured frameworks to handle potential cybersecurity threats effectively.
The paper is also relevant for showing key cybersecurity skills through its discussion of frameworks like COBIT, ITIL, and ISO/IEC 38500. Specifically, the COBIT APO (Align, Plan, Organize) domain highlights planning IT resources, identifying and mitigating risks, and supporting sustainable business operations. Overall, this work demonstrates both strategic thinking and practical IT skills, making it a great example of how governance frameworks contribute to cybersecurity and organizational success.
