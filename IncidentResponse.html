            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Objective 5 required identifying and stopping malicious processes on a compromised host. Tools used included VNC, Remote Desktop Protocol, and Process Explorer to investigate suspicious activity and confirm the presence of WannaCry-related files and processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malicious executables identified included <strong>av.exe</strong>, <strong>mssecsvc2.0</strong>, and <strong>tasksche.exe</strong>, which mimicked legitimate system processes. By analyzing process trees, examining hidden file paths, and inspecting system internals, the malicious services were terminated and the infection contained.
            </p>
            <p>
                This task demonstrates practical incident response skills, including log analysis, system administration commands, and malware verification, reflecting real-world ransomware response procedures.

            <h2>Investigation and Process Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Accessing the infected machine via VNC and RDP, I located the suspicious IP <code>172.16.10.102</code> from prior logs in ELSA. Initial exploration revealed signs of system corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using Sysinternals and Process Explorer, I examined all running processes, including parent/child relationships, loaded DLLs, network connections, CPU/memory usage, and file locations. This allowed the identification of suspicious processes such as <strong>mssecsvc2.0</strong>, <strong>tasksche.exe</strong>, and <strong>av.exe</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hovering over each process revealed the full file paths. Malicious processes were terminated using <code>procexp.exe</code> and <code>sc stop mssecsvc2.0</code> to contain the WannaCry infection and prevent further spread.

            <h2>Malware Cleanup Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Deleted the @WanaDecryptor@ file from the local C drive.</li>
                <li>Opened Process Explorer as Administrator to view all processes.</li>
                <li>Identified suspicious processes and their hidden file paths.</li>
                <li>Terminated malicious processes and their child processes.</li>
                <li>Documented corrupted and hidden paths for further system hardening.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Relevance to Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>
                This exercise highlights core cybersecurity skills: process forensics, malware containment, and system hardening. It demonstrates the ability to analyze, identify, and respond to live threats in an enterprise environment, mirroring real-world incident response.
