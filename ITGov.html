    <main>
        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Trane Technologies is an organization known for its quality and customer satisfaction with the HVAC products that it manufactures and services.
            The company was formerly known as Ingersoll Rand before separating its tools division to focus on Commercial, Residential, and Transportation
            air conditioning, heating, and ventilation (HVAC) systems. These systems serve a wide range of clients—from homes and businesses to public
            transportation. Trane Technologies emphasizes innovation and sustainability, with a strong commitment to environmental responsibility and
            adapting to continuous change.
        </p>

        <h2>Guidelines to Attain IT Governance within the Company</h2>
        <p>
            To establish effective IT governance within any organization, a structured approach is essential to aligning business goals and priorities while
            ensuring compliance with IT policies and guidelines that may otherwise go unrecognized. The following steps are critical in achieving this alignment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Communicate IT strategies and framework benefits</strong> to demonstrate how IT support can enhance business outcomes and meet company goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearly establish and communicate decision-makers</strong> for both IT and business leadership to define roles, responsibilities, and objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement risk management practices</strong> by conducting full assessments of the IT infrastructure to identify data privacy issues, cybersecurity threats, and compliance gaps. Establish disaster recovery plans and mitigation strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify, communicate, and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</strong> to maintain transparency, trust, and reliability in IT governance performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once these steps are implemented, IT governance can be fully integrated with business operations and compliance standards. The IT department must
            continue to monitor progress, adapt to emerging technologies and practices, and communicate changes to align with evolving business needs.
        </p>

        <h2>COBIT Framework</h2>
        <p>
            Structured frameworks such as COBIT, ITIL, and ISO/IEC 38500 help IT departments apply best practices to effectively align business and technology
            requirements. For a global organization like Trane Technologies, <strong>COBIT</strong> is an excellent choice due to its emphasis on sustainability,
            innovation, and global applicability. COBIT practices align with ITIL and ISO standards, providing a strong foundation for comprehensive IT governance.
        </p>
        <p>
            After selecting COBIT, the IT team would focus on guiding the organization through its domains to strengthen communication and accountability.
            The implementation process would include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educating the organization on COBIT’s benefits and ensuring leadership commitment.</li>
            <li>Running an analysis of current IT governance and identifying areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Developing a strategic plan based on the organization’s strengths, weaknesses, and sustainability goals.</li>
            <li>Training employees on COBIT principles to ensure company-wide awareness and compliance.</li>
            <li>Integrating the new framework with existing practices while maintaining ongoing monitoring and updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This structured approach ensures that Trane Technologies maintains IT governance compliance while supporting its broader business goals and
            commitment to innovation.
        </p>

        <h2>Recommended COBIT Domain for Trane Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>APO (Align, Plan, and Organize)</strong> domain of COBIT is particularly relevant for Trane Technologies. APO enables large organizations
            to understand and support IT initiatives that promote business sustainability and innovation. By applying APO, Trane Technologies can effectively:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan IT resources and technology needs to align with strategic business goals.</li>
            <li>Develop realistic budget expectations for IT operations and innovation efforts.</li>
            <li>Identify and mitigate potential IT risks and operational impacts to maintain efficiency and reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This proactive alignment strengthens the relationship between IT and business functions, ensuring that IT governance continues to support
            Trane Technologies’ long-term vision of sustainable growth and operational excellence.
